## The Favicon Issue

The globe icon instead of your logo is a separate issue. See FAVICON-INSTRUCTIONS.md for the fix.

**Quick summary:**
1. Convert Logo.png to favicon.ico at https://favicon.io
2. Upload favicon files to public/ folder
3. Deploy site
4. Request re-indexing in Google Search Console
5. Wait 1-3 days for Google to update

## Reality Check

**"DJ Ozzy" alone is tough to rank for because:**
- It's a short, generic term
- Other DJs might use similar names
- You're competing with established brands
- Google prefers more specific searches

**But you CAN dominate:**
- "DJ Ozzy Southern Utah" ✅
- "DJ Ozzy St George" ✅
- "DJ Ozzy Entertainment" ✅
- "DJ Ozzy school dance Utah" ✅

**Strategy:** Own the local + name searches first, then expand to just the name.
